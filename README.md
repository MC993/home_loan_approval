# Home Loan Approval Project

In this project I'm working on historical data from a home loan company.

The request is to use the data to build a predictive model which users can use when making a loan request.
The users will receive immediately a feedback stating whether they are going to be eligible for a loan or not.

The results are achived via:

EDA & Data Cleaning
Features Engineering
Hyperparameters tuning
Model Training and deployment
Streamlit app development

Please find the related notebook on the repository.
